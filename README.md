# 🧩 Chess (C++ Project)

This project was originally created for my c++ course to practice and demonstrate:

- Class design & inheritance (Piece → Pawn, Bishop, Knight, etc.)
- Polymorphism using virtual functions
- Dynamic memory management
- Encapsulation & modular code structure
- Game logic implementation
- STL Containers
- Algorithms

The program is a console-based chess game that supports move validation, piece movement rules, capturing, and game state tracking.

## 📄 Features

- Full 8×8 chess board  
- Individual classes for each piece  
- Valid move checking for all piece types  
- Tracking moves using a Game Recorder class  
- Board display and piece rendering  
- Clear OOP architecture (base class + derived classes)
- Replay rewind of the game

## 💡 Notes

This project focuses on learning OOP principles and STL, not full competitive chess rules (castling, en passant, checkmate detection, etc. may vary depending on implementation).
